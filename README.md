## Hello, world! ðŸŒŽ
I'm Micah, a teen web developer, graphic designer, and musician making his way in the world of technology.  Beyond my interests in online web development, I'm interested in web technologies everywhere - specifically projects like Capacitor and Electron.  If you want to check out some of the projects I have worked on and some that are still in development, scroll down!
